In this project the A* algorithm has been implemented on a rigid robot.

## External Dependencies:
pygame:
To install: ````pip install pygame````

## Steps to run the program:
Change the directory on terminal using cd to the file location.
Download the repository from GitHub: https://github.com/pbhargav96/Project-3-Phase-2

Running the point robot file: 
`````
python A_star_robot.py
`````
The user will asked to input the start and goal points, in terms of x and y coordinates and the orientation. 
In addition, the user will be prompted to input the the radius and clearance of the robot.
Default values- (xi,yi,o1,xg,yg,clearance,radius):(50,30,60,150,150,1,1).
The algorithm will run once the goal is found a visual representation of the optimal path will be displayed on the screen.
